I have completed the implementation of the associated model capabilities for tasks and phases per the specification. 

Here is a summary of what has been accomplished:

### Phase 1: Core Domain Update
* Modified `Task`, `CreateTask`, and `UpdateTask` structures in `crates/flowstate-core/src/task.rs` to include five optional capability fields: `research_capability`, `design_capability`, `plan_capability`, `build_capability`, and `verify_capability`.
* Implemented `Task::capability_for_action` mapping `ClaudeAction` execution phases (like `Research` and `Build`) to their respective required tier constraints, properly inheriting parent phase parameters for `Distill` phases.
* Added corresponding unit tests verifying phase priority resolution mapping.

### Phase 2: Database Schema & Queries
* Updated the SQLite database instance appending version 12 migrations in `crates/flowstate-db/src/sqlite/migrations.rs` and mapped the parameters via `row_to_task` mapping logic and API methods spanning creation and updating statements in `crates/flowstate-db/src/sqlite/queries/tasks.rs`.
* Created PostgreSQL migration script `V4__add_task_capabilities.sql` expanding the `tasks` schema and implemented binding configurations mapping standard operations throughout `crates/flowstate-db/src/postgres/queries/tasks.rs`.
* Successfully utilized `RunnerCapability::parse_str` enum conversion mapping DB text representations into domain types avoiding trait warnings.
* Expanded the agnostic integration tests covering `Task` structural constraints (including unsetting states testing serialization correctness) within `crates/flowstate-db/tests/common/mod.rs`.

### Phase 3: Run Scheduling & API Integration
* Updated the `trigger_claude_run` route in `crates/flowstate-server/src/routes/claude_runs.rs` evaluating the execution logic properly overriding requested task attributes dynamically based on model capabilities rather than forcing unconditional system defaults. Added standard test harness parameters across existing client testing endpoints adapting to the larger payload structures.
* Ran automated quality gate assurances executing `flowstate-coverage` maintaining > 90% codebase parity mapping along with standard integration unit tests passing cleanly using the latest schema implementations.
