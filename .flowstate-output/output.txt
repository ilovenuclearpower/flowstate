All phases are complete. Here's a summary of everything that was implemented:

## Summary of Changes

### Phase 1: Fix FeedbackInput Disconnect + Extend Mode with Status
- **`crates/flowstate-tui/src/app.rs`**: Added `status: ApprovalStatus` field to `Mode::FeedbackInput` enum variant. Updated `handle_key()` dispatch to pass the status. Updated `handle_feedback_input()` to use the dynamic status instead of hardcoding `Rejected`. Pressing `r` in the approval modal now transitions to `FeedbackInput` mode (fixing the bug where rejection skipped feedback collection).

### Phase 2: Add "Approve with Notes" and "Rerun" Options
- **`crates/flowstate-tui/src/app.rs`**: Added `n` (approve with notes) keybinding that enters `FeedbackInput` with `Approved` status. Added `x` (rerun) keybinding that resets approval status to `None` and clears feedback. Updated `render_approval_pick()` to show 4 options with distinct color-coded keybindings. Updated status bar hints for both `ApprovalPick` and `FeedbackInput` modes. Rendering label changes dynamically ("Notes" vs "Feedback" based on status).

### Phase 3: Forward Reviewer Notes in PromptContext
- **`crates/flowstate-prompts/src/context.rs`**: Added `reviewer_notes: Vec<(String, String)>` field to `PromptContext`. Added rendering in `append_preamble()` — placed after Verification and before Sub-tasks.
- **`crates/flowstate-prompts/src/lib.rs`**: Updated `minimal_ctx()` test helper.
- **`crates/flowstate-runner/src/executor.rs`**: Added reviewer notes collection in `build_prompt_context()` following the forwarding matrix (Design sees Research notes, Plan sees Research+Spec, Build/Verify see all three). Only includes notes from `Approved` phases with non-empty feedback. Skips for distill actions.
- **`crates/flowstate-runner/src/pipeline.rs`** and **`crates/flowstate-server/src/claude.rs`**: Updated `PromptContext` construction sites with `reviewer_notes: vec![]`.

### Phase 4: Tests
- **`crates/flowstate-prompts/src/context.rs`**: 4 new tests (reviewer notes rendering, empty omission, ordering, positioning relative to verification/subtasks).
- **`crates/flowstate-prompts/src/lib.rs`**: 2 new tests (design prompt includes research notes, research prompt has no notes).
- **`crates/flowstate-tui/tests/app_state_machine.rs`**: 4 new tests (approve-with-notes transitions, notes submit approves, rerun resets status, feedback Esc cancels). Updated 2 existing tests to account for the new FeedbackInput step in the reject flow.
