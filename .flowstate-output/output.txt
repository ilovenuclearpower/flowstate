All 10 phases are complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

### Agnostic Runner Interface - Implementation Complete

**Core abstractions:**
- `RunnerCapability` enum (Light/Standard/Heavy) with tier hierarchy and action-to-capability mapping
- `AgentBackend` trait abstracting agent invocation (preflight, run, name, model)
- `ClaudeCliBackend` implementation (extracts existing Claude CLI logic)
- `OpenCodeBackend` stub for future backends

**Runner changes:**
- `RunnerConfig` extended with `--backend` and `--capability` CLI flags
- Backend threaded through entire dispatch chain: main → execute_run → executor → pipeline
- Preflight checks use `backend.preflight_check()` instead of hardcoded Claude CLI checks
- Runner registers with server on startup (capabilities, backend name)
- Health endpoint reports backend, model, and capability info

**Server changes:**
- `POST /api/runners/register` endpoint for runner registration
- Capability-aware claim filtering — runners only receive work matching their tier
- Triggered runs automatically set `required_capability` based on action type

**Database:**
- SQLite v10 migration adding `required_capability` column
- PostgreSQL V2 migration for same
- Claim query filters by runner capabilities (backwards-compatible: empty = claim anything)
