All 7 phases are complete. Here's a summary of what was done and the final status:

## Implementation Complete

All phases of the multi-provider git platform abstraction have been implemented:

**Phase 1-6** (completed in previous session):
- Added `ProviderType` enum (Github/Gitea) to `flowstate-core`
- SQLite v11 and Postgres V3 migrations for `provider_type` and `skip_tls_verify` columns
- Extended `RepoProvider` trait with `preflight()`, PR comment/review methods
- Provider factory with auto-detection and explicit configuration
- HTTPS enforcement
- Full Gitea provider via `reqwest` HTTP API
- Enhanced GitHub provider with PR comment/review methods via `gh api`
- Updated all callers: pipeline, salvage, executor, workspace, preflight
- Provider-agnostic TUI health check

**Phase 7** (completed now — fixing test compilation issues):
- Fixed `workspace_integration.rs` — added 4th `skip_tls_verify: bool` arg to all 9 `ensure_repo()` calls
- Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to `GiteaProvider`
- Fixed `unwrap_err()` on `Box<dyn RepoProvider>` by using `.err().expect()` instead

## Test Results
- **506 unit tests pass, 0 failures** (34 ignored integration tests)
- **Clippy clean** with `-D warnings`
- **`flowstate-coverage` fails** — but this is a **pre-existing issue on main** (S3 tests fail under `cargo llvm-cov` due to environment variable propagation; they pass fine under regular `cargo test`)

## Files Modified/Created
- 19 modified files + 2 new files (`gitea.rs`, `V3__add_provider_type.sql`)
